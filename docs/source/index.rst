QGIS Safecast Plugin Documentation
==================================

This plugin allows to easily load data from `Safecast
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safecast_(organization)>`__ radiation
monitoring devices (LOG file) like :ref:`bGeigie Nano <bgeigie>` into
QGIS as a new vector point layer. The data are loaded using predefined
color style.

The user can, if necessary, easily select and remove unwanted parts of
the measurement set and save the corrected set as a new LOG file for
uploading to `Safecast web map <http://safecast.org/tilemap/>`__.
